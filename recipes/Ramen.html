<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>
    We all grew up eating instant noodles from time to time as our parents were very busy and they knew we would always be happy to eat ramen soup. Although we would always use the seasoning pack, they always made sure to add nutritious toppings. As we grew older, we still get cravings for instant noodles but like to experiment on different types of broth. A random evening, during our Uni days, with nothing much in the fridge, Martin made this delicious and easy sriracha ramen! You'll only need very simple and pantry-staple ingredients. Who doesn't have sriracha in their fridge nowadays?
