<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>
    The people of Ishgard used to ignore me when i'd get close to their city, but there was a nice Elezen with silver hair that I met in Dragonhead once. He wasn't like the Other knights and shared what he called knight's bread with me. I wanted to say hello on our trip around Eorzea but i haven't been able to find him yet. I'm sure I'll run into him eventually; he has to try my version of his snack, Kupo!.
