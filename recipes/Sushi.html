</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul class="ingredients_bx">
    <li>
        Unagi: unagi or bbq grilled freshwater eel is sold in Japanese grocery stores and some Asian grocery stores in the frozen aisle. Some will come pre-packaged with the unagi sauce
     </li>

    <li>
        Unagi Sauce: you can either create your own homemade unagi sauce or buy premade unagi sauce.
    </li>

    <li>
        Sushi Rice: you will need short-grain or medium-grain sushi rice. Sushi rice has more starch and thus is stickier and will hold its shape when you mold it.
    </li>

    <li>
        Rice Vinegar: rice vinegar adds a delicate, mild sweet acidic flavor to the rice.
    </li>

    <li>
        Sugar: sugar sweetens and balances the acidity of the rice vinegar.
    </li>

    <li>
        Salt: a pinch of salt seasons the sushi rice.
    </li>

    <li>
        Nori Seaweed Sheet: the nori seaweed sheet will be used to bind the unagi to the rice
    </li>

    <li>
        Toasted sesame seeds: sprinkle on some toasted sesame seeds for garnish and added crunch and nutty flavor.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol class="steps_bx">
    <li>
        Cook the rice. Wash the rice until the water runs clear. Add the washed rice and water to your rice cooker and cook.
    </li>

    <li>
        Season the rice. In a small mixing bowl, mix together the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until the sugar dissolves. Then drizzle the mixture over the cooked rice and carefully mix it with a rice paddle until combined.
    </li>

    <li>
        Cook the unagi. Place the unagi onto an aluminum lined baking tray and bake at 350°F (176°C) for 15 minutes or according to the package instruction.
    </li>

    <li>
        Slice the unagi. Using a sharp knife, slice the unagi longwise down the middle. Then unagi against the grain holding the knife at a 45-degree angle. Cut the eel diagonally into about 3-inch long and 1-inch wide pieces.
    </li>

    <li>
        Shape the rice. Wet your hand with water and place about 1 tablespoon of seasoned rice into your palm. Squeeze your fingers over the rice, rotate and squeeze again and repeat until you create small oval pieces.
    </li>

    <li>
        Assemble. Place the thinly sliced eel on top of the rice and lightly brush the top with unagi sauce. Wrap a thin strip of nori around the middle and garnish with sesame seeds.
    </li>

    <li>
        Serve the unagi nigiri with soy sauce, wasabi, and ginger. Enjoy!
